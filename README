== Represent

This is a small demo mash-up Ruby on Rails app that takes a physical address in the U.S., geocodes it, and then looks up the state and federal legislators who represent someone living at that location.

It is *not* production-ready. For one thing, it's slower'n a locomotive with sand in its tender.

It requires one or more VoteSmart API keys to be placed in a config/votesmart.yml file like this:
development:
  api_key: foo
test:
  api_key: bar
production:
  api_key: baz
